[00:00.17] Hey bestie, don't worry
[00:01.92] These screenshots, tell stories
[00:03.69] Hey bestie, don't worry
[00:05.33] You saw him? He's horny
[00:07.32] Hey bestie, don't worry
[00:09.08] I caught her, it's gory!
[00:11.09] Hey bestie, you see this?
[00:12.80] Oh god they're such a-
[00:23.80] 
[00:28.71] Greet the bouncer for a moment
[00:31.02] Music blaring, cameras rollin'
[00:32.82] Take a hit, playback the preview
[00:34.80] Wait a sec- hey, is that M*ku?
[00:36.79] At the party I can see
[00:38.47] An idol girl with angel wings
[00:40.16] She's talking, acting anxiously
[00:42.14] With candid photo vanity
[00:54.14] 
[00:43.81] Down a shot, let's get it started
[00:45.97] Grab your camera, lock on target
[00:47.81] Focus lens, hey, no one's safe when
[00:49.52] The rabbit's in the lion's den
[01:04.52] 
[00:51.64] Eat your heart out, ain't that right?
[00:52.94] A Mary Sue with pretty eyes
[00:54.91] A stupid bitch with petty lies
[00:56.15] They color a knife
[01:05.15] 
[00:58.78] Offer your heart like a drug
[01:01.03] We'll open it up, twist it up, with a shrug
[01:06.46] Offer your mind like a shot
[01:08.25] When you think your safe, with the camera, you're caught
[01:36.25] 
[01:13.30] Offer your heart like a drug
[01:15.92] We'll open it up, twist it up, with a shrug
[01:20.96] Offer your mind like a shot
[01:23.57] When you think your safe, with the camera, you're caught
[01:51.57] 
[01:28.35] Greet the bouncer for a moment
[01:30.26] Music blaring, cameras rollin'
[01:31.80] Take a hit, playback the preview
[01:33.87] Wait a sec- hey, was that M*ku?
[01:35.43] At the party I can see
[01:37.40] The idol girl with melting wings
[01:39.27] She's breaking down, her eyes on me
[01:41.25] Her candid photo vanity
[01:52.75] 
[01:43.22] Down a shot, let's get it started
[01:44.90] Grab your camera, lock on target
[01:46.95] Take a photo, take her lifeline
[01:48.61] Cry for help? Well, now she's lying
[01:50.67] I just call it how it is, yeah
[01:52.41] I just call it how it is
[01:54.16] A stupid bitch with petty lies-
[02:09.66] 
[02:13.58] "Freak! You're such a freak!"
[02:16.59] Well sorry, but I'm just being me
[02:19.97] Let's party
[02:21.50] "Freak! You're such a freak!"
[02:23.93] Well sorry, but I'm just being me
[02:27.62] Let's party!
[02:33.62] 
[02:28.92] "Freak! You're such a freak!" (Well sorry, but I'm just being me, let's party!)
[02:35.98] "Freak! You're such a freak!" (Well sorry, but I'm just being me, let's party!)
[02:43.30] "Freak! You're such a freak!" (These screenshots tell stories)
[02:47.25] "Freak! You're such a freak!" (Let's party!)
[02:50.95] "Freak! You're such a freak!" (I caught her, it's gory!)
[02:54.65] I'm just being me (Let's party!)
